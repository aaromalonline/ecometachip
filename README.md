This paper presents the Eco-MetaChip Mini, a novel, low-cost, and eco-friendly system for the preliminary identification of common liquids (water, ethanol, acetone, and petrol) based on changes in their relative permittivity (ϵr). The core sensing element is a flexible, biodegradable coir-rubber composite patch, an innovative material developed by Prof. Dr. Anju Pradeep and her colleagues at the School of Engineering, CUSAT. This patch is integrated into a non-contact, high frequency (approximately 100 MHz) hartley oscillator circuit, where it acts as a coupled secondary resonator. The presence of a liquid droplet on the patch significantly alters its effective dielectric constant, causing a corresponding change in the coupled magnetic field amplitude. This amplitude fluctuation is detected by a pickup coil, rectified, filtered, and then amplified to drive a visual output system using red, green, and blue LEDs. The system successfully demonstrates clear and distinct cutoff voltage responses for liquids with significantly varying dielectric constants, establishing a fast, resource-constrained, and sustainable approach to chemical sensing.
